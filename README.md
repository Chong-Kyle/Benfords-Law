These are the instructions on how to run the program. The following files must be placed in specific folders in the project folder so that the program runs properly. Make sure you have JDK 11 installed on VSCode. As well, make sure you have JavaFX installed on your computer and remember the file path for later. For VSCode, make sure you have the extensions: JavaFX Support, and optionally, FXML Viewer. For VSCode, create a project folder by doing Ctrl + Shift + P and typing in "Create Java Project", select No Build Tools, and place the folder in a location you want. When the project folder is created, click the 'src' folder and run App.java. This will make 'JAVA PROJECTS' show up on the left hand side. Click it and then go to 'Referenced Libraries' and click '+'. Go to where you put the JavaFX folder, click 'lib' and select all the JAR files (There should be 8) and click 'Select Jar Libraries'. Now take the files from the git repositories and place them in their respective folders. For App.java, DistributionChart.fxml, Mainframe.java, and sales.csv, place them in the 'src' folder. For launch.json, place this file inside of '.vscode' and change the file path for where you placed the JavaFX file where the text tells you to. For example "D:\\Desktop\\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\\lib". If you want to run the program now, go to App.java and run the program.
